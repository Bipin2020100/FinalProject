# Authorization and Authentication app

Developed a React app using NodeJS for server and JWT token for user
Authorization and Authentication. I used express for backend, MongoDB for
database and RESTapi to structure server. The application works on role based
authentication. React routes were used along with state management.
Tokanized data were saved in the local storage to use data as per the
functionality.
