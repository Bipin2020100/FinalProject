# FinalProject

This is project I worked on authorization and authentication using the JWT token. I used MongoDB for database, express for backend and react for my frontend. Users with username and password can only get into the app to use it. Datas are passed through the token to the frontend to use as per the functionality executed by user in the frontend.
